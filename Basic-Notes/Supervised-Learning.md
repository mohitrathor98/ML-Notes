Supervised Learning
---------------------

- `Classification` - We will predict for any future set of data "class" is 'g'(1) or 'h'(0)
- `Fetures` - All the values (cols) that we will use to predict an output. In this case, from ["fLength" to "fDist"]
- `Labels` - The output that needs to be predicted using the features. In this case "class" col.

### Different Kinds of predictions

1. Classification - predict discrete classes

    ```
    Ex: Predicting Hot Dog, Pizza or Ice-Cream based on image vector provided.

    This is called Multiclass Classification.

    ```

    ```
    Binary classification.
    Ex: Predicting if images are Hot dog or not hot dog. Cat/Dog. Or Spam/Not Spam.
        or Positive/Negative.
    ```

2. Regression - predict continuous values.

    ```
    Price of etherium, Price of House, Temperature of a region, etc.
    ```
