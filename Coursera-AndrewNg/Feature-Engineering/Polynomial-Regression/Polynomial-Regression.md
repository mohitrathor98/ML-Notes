# Polynomial Regression

- Sometimes, the given data set doesn't work with straight lines.
- Need to change our function to get the expected curve.

- We can also combine different features to help our model to converge faster.

        For ex: Given Feature X1 - Width of room and X2-Length
                We can find X3 = X1*X2 to get the area of room.

- We can make our functions to some polynomial like quadratic, cubic or square root.
