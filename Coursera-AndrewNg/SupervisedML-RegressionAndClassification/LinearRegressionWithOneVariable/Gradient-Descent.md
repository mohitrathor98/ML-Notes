### Gradient Descent

- A machine learning algorithm to determine minimum values of a function.

- Idea is to change the value of w and b so that we reach near the minimum of the cost function J(w, b).

- Works by adjusting the parameters in the direction of negative gradient(i.e, descent) of the function.

- By taking the steps in the negative descent direction, we eventually reach the minimum value of the function.
