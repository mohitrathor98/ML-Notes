### Flow of Training a supervised Model

- Training sets contains features and targets

- We feed the training set to a supervised learning algorithm.

- The algorithm produces a function or hypothesis.

- The function takes any new `x` as input and gives output as prediction `y-hat`.

- y-hat: Predition of the Model

- y: Actual target that we want to achieve.


### Defining the function or model f in Linear Regression with one variable.

    fw,b(x) = wx + b

    or

    f(x) = wx + b
