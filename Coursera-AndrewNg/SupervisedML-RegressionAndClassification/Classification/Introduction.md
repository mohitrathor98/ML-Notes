# Classification

- The output Y can be one of the few possible outcomes.
- Instead of a ranger of values, seen in regressions.

## Binary Classification

- Output Y can only be among two values.
- True or False, 0 or 1.
- 0 can mean absence of anything and 1 can mean presence of anything.

- Ex: Spam Classification. 0 - Message is not spam. 1 - Message is spam.

***[Note]:*** If we try to solve a classification problem using linear regression, then outputs can't be predicted based on a curve or straight line.

- We use <strong>Logistic Regression</strong> as algorithm to solve classification problem.
